# Session 2.2

To run the program, simply run this line in the terminal:
```bash
$ python3 blackjack.py
```
And you should be able to play a simplified form of blackjack. Still working on the **Refactor the blackjack code** part.


### 6. (Optional) Implement more Blackjack rules

Find out what the full set of rules are for blackjack.  There are many subtleties that have been left out of the current implementation.  Find one such subtlety and implement it in the refactored codebase.  If you have done a good job of design then adding a new rule should affect a small number of locations in the codebase.  Think about how it would have been implemented in the old design, and whether this is an improvement or not.
